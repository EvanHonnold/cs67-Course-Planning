# cs67-Course-Planning
This repository contains the group project made by Evan Honnold, Tim Tadros, Amara Gordon, and Jolene Bernagene for Dartmouth's CS67 course (Human-Computer Interaction). Our project is a tool to help students choose courses in accordance with their Major and Minor and the College's distributive requirements.
