Proposed way to divide work for the project:

Phase 1: Create the HTML/CSS visual interface
  a) introductory information forms (i.e. what's your major, what classes have you taken)
  b) left side of the three-part main screen (current plan)
  c) middle part of the main screen (course browser)
  d) right side of the main screen (requirements view)

Phase 2: Code the interaction with the interface 

Phase 3: Code the back-end
